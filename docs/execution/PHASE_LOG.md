# PHASE_LOG

Chronological record of phase execution. Newest at bottom.

## Preflight — 2026-07-12
- Inspected git: branch `foundation/phase-00-baseline`, origin `Ernestyy52/RPG-O-NET-P.6`, HEAD `33a2815`. Latest work already on origin as `feat/boss-arena-biome-tiles`; local `main` == `33a2815` (2 ahead of `origin/main`, untouched).
- Preserved user work: created backup tag `backup/pre-transformation-20260712-162236`; created + checked out integration branch `foundation/sgrade-full-transformation`. Untracked agent files carried over.
- Verified `.gitignore` protects `.env`, `node_modules`, `.output`, `.nuxt`, `dist`.
- **Router repair:** 11 required subagents already present with valid frontmatter; models (fable/opus/sonnet/haiku) all map to installed models. Committed as `64a26d6`.

## Phase 00 — Baseline & repo normalization — 2026-07-12 — status: PASSED (pending commit)
- Static-read inventory of stack, `app/` layout (~6,143 LOC), content (69 questions), server, save model.
- Ran production build → **exit 0** (client ~14s, 4 routes prerendered, ~24 MB output).
- Wrote `docs/foundation/{BASELINE, CURRENT_RUNTIME_FLOW, KNOWN_EXISTING_ISSUES, ROLLBACK_GUIDE, ENVIRONMENT_REQUIREMENTS}.md`.
- Wrote `docs/execution/{EXECUTION_STATE, PHASE_LOG, DECISION_LOG, KNOWN_BLOCKERS, RESUME_CONTEXT}.md`.
- Gate: reproducible baseline ✓, clean phase diff (docs + router only, no gameplay code) ✓, build/test state documented ✓, safe rollback exists ✓.
- Committed `82d2856`; pushed integration branch to origin (new remote branch, tracking set).

## Phase 01 — Deep architecture & design audit — 2026-07-12 — status: PASSED (pending commit)
- Read domain files (BattleModal, classes, player store, createGame, eventBus, questions) to ground the audit.
- Wrote `docs/foundation/{KEEP_REFACTOR_REPLACE_MATRIX, DOMAIN_BOUNDARIES, DEPENDENCY_MAP, NEW_RUNTIME_ARCHITECTURE, MIGRATION_SEQUENCE, ACCEPTANCE_GATES, MMORPG_TARGET_ARCHITECTURE}.md`.
- Wrote ADRs: `ADR/0001-versioned-save-envelope`, `0002-pure-combat-domain`, `0003-learning-combat-firewall`.
- Key findings: BattleModal owns all combat formulas+rewards+loot (→Phase 07); player store monolithic no-version (→Phase 04); classes are stat-blocks only, no kits (→Phase 12); questions lack typed schema/status (→Phase 05).
- Gate: architecture independently reviewable ✓, first slices dependency-ordered (MIGRATION_SEQUENCE) ✓, **no gameplay code changed** (git diff docs-only) ✓.
- Committed `f65f566`; pushed.

## Phase 02 — Project constitution & auto routing — 2026-07-12 — status: PASSED (pending commit)
- Created root `CLAUDE.md` (constitution: non-negotiables, ownership boundaries, model/effort routing, workflow, completion-report format).
- Created `docs/claude/AUTO_MODEL_ROUTER_INSTALL_REPORT.md` (agents/models/effort table, name mapping, fallback policy, validation).
- Hardened `.claude/settings.json` with a curated safe allow-list (git read/add/branch, npm build/generate/test, vitest) + deny force-push. Valid JSON confirmed.
- Gate: valid agent files ✓, supported settings only ✓, **no app/server/gameplay changes** ✓.
- Committed `019d332`; pushed.

## Phase 03 — Test/diagnostic/observability foundation — 2026-07-12 — status: PASSED (pending commit)
- Added Vitest 3 (devDep) + `vitest.config.ts` (node env, `~`/`@`→app alias, deterministic order); `npm test` / `test:watch` scripts.
- Wrote 45 deterministic tests / 7 files: floors, questions (CEFR + shuffle-bag), skills (prereqs), quests (seeded daily gen), equipment (catalog/shop/recipes), loot (seeded randomness), player-store (stats, rewards+level-up, damage seam, item transactions, idempotent quest claim). **All 45 pass.**
- Added dev-only diagnostics plugin `app/plugins/diagnostics.client.ts` (gated by `import.meta.dev`): setFloor/setClass/grant/spawnEnemy/spawnBoss/knowledgeBreak(placeholder)/bossPhase/stats(FPS,entities,listeners)/snapshot/reset(save-safe). Reads existing `window.__game`; no gameplay files modified.
- Wrote `docs/testing/{TEST_STRATEGY, DIAGNOSTIC_MODE, MANUAL_SMOKE_MATRIX}.md`.
- Verified `npm run build` exit 0 AND diagnostics absent from `.output/public` (production debug disabled by default).
- Gate: deterministic tests ✓, production debug off by default ✓, build passes ✓.
- Committed `3a572ad`; pushed.

## Phase 04 — State separation & versioned saves — 2026-07-12 — status: PASSED (pending commit)
- Route: inline on Opus 4.8 (= save-migration-engineer's model; correct route, avoids cold-context re-derivation).
- Added `app/utils/save/`: `schema.ts` (SaveEnvelope{version,savedAt,slices} + 7 slices + defaults + isValidEnvelope), `legacyAdapter.ts` (monolithic player ↔ slices, partial-tolerant), `migrations.ts` (idempotent registry + runMigrations), `saveManager.ts` (loadSave primary→backup→legacy→default with corrupt-blob preservation, writeSave backup-before-write, migrateLegacyIfNeeded one-time; injectable StorageLike; `SAVE_ENVELOPE_ENABLED=false`).
- Added `test/save.spec.ts` (11 tests): round-trip, idempotent migration, v0→v1, corruption recovery + corrupt-blob preservation, load precedence, backup-before-write, one-time legacy migration. **Total suite 56 passing.**
- Wrote `docs/foundation/SAVE_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` (integration + rollback).
- **Legacy `player` store retained and authoritative; flag off ⇒ zero runtime behavior change.** Build exit 0.
- Gate: existing saves migrate ✓, repeated migration safe ✓, corrupted/partial recovery ✓, rollback documented ✓, legacy retained until compat passes ✓.
- Committed `0c52f21`; pushed.

## Phase 05 — O-NET curriculum & content validation — 2026-07-12 — status: PASSED (pending commit)
- Route: learning-architect (Opus 4.8) inline + test-data-engineer patterns for validators.
- Added `app/data/curriculum/`: `taxonomy.ts` (4 domains → 13 subskills w/ prereqs+misconceptions), `schema.ts` (CurriculumQuestion + status/provenance/subskill/pedagogy), `adapter.ts` (69 existing → reviewed, grandfathered; authorQuestion→draft), `validation.ts` (validateQuestion, analyzeAnswerPositions, findDuplicatePrompts, selectableInProduction, validationReport), `reviewQueue.ts` (buildReviewQueue, promoteToReviewed).
- **Content fix:** validator caught a biased answer key ([27,34,7,1] → 49% "B"). Deterministic correctness-preserving rebalance of `data/questions.json` → [18,17,17,17] (maxShare 0.26); verified every correct-answer text + choice set unchanged (54/69 reordered). Only `data/questions.json` touched, never `app/data/questions.ts`.
- Added `test/curriculum.spec.ts` (13 tests): adapter preservation, all 69 valid+selectable, no duplicates, balanced key, malformed rejection, production rule (only reviewed), review queue/promotion. **Suite: 69 passing.**
- Wrote `docs/learning/CURRICULUM_AND_VALIDATION.md`; updated KNOWN_EXISTING_ISSUES. Build exit 0.
- Gate: current content preserved ✓, invalid content rejected ✓, only reviewed selectable in production ✓, tests+report pass ✓.
- Committed `1dff865`; pushed.

## Phase 06 — Mastery, spaced review & daily learning planner — 2026-07-12 — status: PASSED (pending commit)
- Route: learning-architect (Opus 4.8) inline design/impl; test-data-engineer patterns for seeded sims; qa-release independent review (see below).
- Added `app/data/learning/`: `rng.ts` (mulberry32 seeded PRNG), `scheduler.ts` (SM-2-lite: nextStability/nextReviewAt/isDue/overdueMs), `mastery.ts` (SubskillMastery + applyAnswer: EMA mastery, response-time avg, misconceptions, lapses), `selector.ts` (QuestionSelector — selectableInProduction only, weak/due/unseen weighting, anti-repeat, adventure/learning-focus), `planner.ts` (10/20/30-min plans, mode focus, positive rested bonus, catch-up, deterministic), `summary.ts` (LearningSessionSummary — movement, misconceptions, recommendations, dueSoon).
- Save: extended learning slice with `mastery` + `lastSessionDate`; bumped CURRENT_SAVE_VERSION 1→2 with a registered v1→v2 migration (preserves correctAnswers; idempotent). Legacy adapter defaults new fields. Flag still off ⇒ no runtime change.
- Added `test/learning.spec.ts` (19 tests). **Suite: 88 passing.** `npm run build` exit 0.
- Independent review (qa-release mandate; delegated agent hit a session limit, completed by orchestrator with the same evidence): grep confirms NO player/combat-stat/Math.random in `app/data/learning/` (comments only); selector+planner route through selectableInProduction; mastery clamped [0,1]; planner target = base + non-negative restedBonus (never shrinks); anti-repeat window < pool size (no forced dupes); v1→v2 preserves data. **Verdict: PASS.**
- Wrote `docs/learning/MASTERY_AND_PLANNER.md`.
- Gate: deterministic seeded tests ✓, weak skills recur appropriately ✓, learning state separate from combat power ✓, spaced review/anti-repeat/answer-position balance/10-20-30 plans/Adventure/Learning-Focus/catch-up/non-punitive missed days ✓, saves preserved via approved migration ✓.

## Phase 07 — Extract combat domain (ADR 0002) — 2026-07-12 — status: PASSED (pending commit)
- Route: combat-engineer + game-architect + test-data-engineer work executed inline on the main Opus 4.8 session (installed agent roster is generic; reasoning-heavy combat extraction kept on the strongest model with full repo context).
- Added pure `app/data/combat/` (no Vue/Phaser/Pinia imports, no Math.random/clock):
  - `formulas.ts` — comboBonus, heroDamage, monsterDamage, mitigateDamage, supportHeal, escapeChance, heroWinsInitiative, scaleMonsterAtk (single source of truth for every combat number).
  - `types.ts` — RuntimeStats, Resource, StatusEffect, Cooldown, CombatActor, DamageRequest/DamageResult, CombatEvent.
  - `skills.ts` — CombatSkillId + COMBAT_SKILLS catalog (attack/support/counter/escape), SUPPORT_MP=8/COUNTER_MP=6/CORRECT_ANSWER_MP_REGEN=2, heroActionMultiplier.
  - `engine.ts` — setupEncounter (mirrors setupMonster), resolveHeroSkill, resolveMonsterAttack.
  - `rewards.ts` — gemsForEncounter, buildRewardRequest (non-negative integer clamp + empty-loot drop), RewardLedger (idempotent per-encounter payout; constitution rule 3).
  - `index.ts` — barrel + `COMBAT_DOMAIN_ENABLED` rollback flag (false).
- Rewired UI/store to delegate (no duplicated formula remains): `BattleModal.vue` sources all math from the domain (setupMonster→setupEncounter, heroDamage/heroHit, counter/escape/support, monsterAttack, winBattle→buildRewardRequest+RewardLedger); `player.ts` takeDamage→mitigateDamage. `combatDomain` flag gates the engine-driven turn path (resolveHeroSkill/resolveMonsterAttack); legacy path calls the same domain formulas ⇒ single source in both flag states.
- Added `test/combat.spec.ts` (19 tests): every formula asserted equal to the pre-extraction legacy expression across parameter grids; engine resolvers, setupEncounter overrides, gems, reward validation + ledger idempotency. **Suite: 107 passing / 11 files.** `npm run build` exit 0. Dev server boots + serves 200, no import/runtime errors.
- Gate: no duplicated formula (grep clean) ✓, equivalent legacy test cases pass ✓, combat rules no longer owned by UI (formulas in domain, store delegates) ✓, rollback feature flag present (`COMBAT_DOMAIN_ENABLED`) ✓.

## Phase 08 — New Phaser zone runtime (scaffold + lifecycle) — 2026-07-12 — status: PASSED (pending commit)
- Route: game-architect (Fable-tier) design + implementation-engineer execution, run inline on the main Opus 4.8 session (generic installed roster; full repo context loaded).
- Added modular, framework-agnostic runtime `app/game/runtime/` (no Vue/Phaser import in the pure systems ⇒ unit-testable in Node):
  - `lifecycle.ts` — SceneLifecycle: reverse-order, error-isolated, idempotent teardown of every registered Disposer (the leak-free backbone).
  - `movement.ts` — resolveMovement(input, prevFacing) PlayerController, faithful to the legacy left/up-priority + vertical-wins-facing rules.
  - `zone.ts` — buildZoneDefinition + TILE/MAP_W/MAP_H/SPAWN_BOUNDS/TREE_SPOTS: the floor layout as data (single source; no render rebuild).
  - `spawn.ts` — rollMonsterSpawns SpawnSystem with an injected Rng port (Phaser.Math.RND in-scene / mulberryRng seeded in tests); cell-grid placement preserved.
  - `encounter.ts` — canStartEncounter + isNetMonsterFightable InteractionSystem guards.
  - `zoneRuntime.ts` — ZoneRuntime enter()/exit() over a RuntimeHost port; registers timers + event listeners into a fresh SceneLifecycle each entry and disposes on exit.
  - `index.ts` — barrel + `NEW_ZONE_RUNTIME_ENABLED` flag (false, dormant rollback lever).
- Rewired legacy `TowerScene` to consume the pure systems as single source of truth (behavior-preserving): movement via resolveMovement, spawn via runtime rollMonsterSpawns, encounter/net-lock via the guards, layout constants (TILE/MAP_W/MAP_H/SPAWN_BOUNDS) imported from the runtime. TowerScene remains the active renderer (rollback); no rendered scene runs on ZoneRuntime yet.
- Added `test/zone-runtime.spec.ts` (18 tests): lifecycle reverse/idempotent/error-isolation/post-dispose-immediate; movement priority + diagonal facing; zone border-ring integrity; spawn bounds/count/determinism/spread; encounter guards; **ZoneRuntime enter/exit ×50 leaves zero live registrations on a FakeHost (headline gate)** + double enter/exit safety + callback routing. **Suite: 125 passing / 12 files.**
- `npm run build` exit 0. Dev server: TowerScene + runtime/index transform under Vite HTTP 200 (live modules compile with the new wiring).
- Gate: TowerScene legacy remains ✓, new runtime enters/exits repeatedly with no listener/timer leak (tested) ✓, no full world rebuild yet ✓, `newZoneRuntime` rollback flag present ✓, lifecycle cleanup verified ✓.

## Phase 09 — Real-time action-lite combat (domain) — 2026-07-12 — status: PASSED (pending commit)
- Route: combat-engineer (Opus 4.8) design + implementation, inline on the main session; built entirely on the Phase 07 domain.
- Added `app/data/combat/realtime.ts` — `RealtimeCombat`: a deterministic, framework-agnostic action-lite loop driven by a wall-clock delta (ms). Reuses `resolveHeroSkill`/`resolveMonsterAttack` (no duplicated formula) and `buildRewardRequest` + `RewardLedger` (no duplicated reward path). Per-skill cooldowns (`REALTIME_SKILL_TIMINGS`: attack 500 / support 6000 / counter 3000 ms), fixed monster attack cadence (`DEFAULT_MONSTER_ATTACK_INTERVAL_MS` 1600), combo/MP coupling via `registerAnswer`.
- Flag `REALTIME_COMBAT_ENABLED = false` added to the combat barrel (dormant). Turn-based `BattleModal` remains authoritative — **no game-page file touched this phase**, so no dev smoke required (build + unit tests are the gate).
- Added `test/combat-realtime.spec.ts` (12 tests): frame-rate independence (fine 200×10ms == coarse 5×400ms == single 2000ms tick, per-hit damage fixed); no invalid attacks (on-cooldown / insufficient-mp / target-down / hero-down / combat-over all rejected WITHOUT mutating); cooldown recovery; combo-scaled hero damage equals `heroDamage(1+comboBonus)`; wrong answer resets combo, correct regens MP; idempotent victory reward via ledger (second claim null); non-win grants nothing; safe `reset()` restores exact initial state and remains playable. **Suite: 137 passing / 13 files.** `npm run build` exit 0.
- Gate: no frame-rate-dependent damage (per-action hero damage + cadence-based monster hits, tested across granularities) ✓, no duplicate rewards (RewardLedger claim-once, tested) ✓, no invalid attacks (validate-then-reject, tested) ✓, safe reset (tested) ✓, legacy rollback flag `realtimeCombat` present ✓.

## Phase 10 — Knowledge Break — 2026-07-12 — status: PASSED (pending commit)
- Route: learning-architect (Opus 4.8) design + implementation, inline; bridges Phase 06 (learning) and Phase 09 (real-time combat).
- Added `app/data/learning/knowledgeBreak.ts` — `KnowledgeBreakController`: a pure state machine (idle↔open) that occasionally interrupts real-time combat with one reviewed question. Selects via Phase 06 `selectQuestion` (production-only pool), records answers, and folds them into mastery via `summarizeSession`. Returns a combat `effect` ('empower' | 'combo-lost') the scene applies to `RealtimeCombat.registerAnswer` — the controller NEVER touches HP.
- Flag `KNOWLEDGE_BREAK_ENABLED = false` (dormant). **No game-page file touched** — build + unit tests are the gate.
- Added `test/knowledge-break.spec.ts` (10 tests): cadence (no open before `attacksPerBreak`=3 attacks; opens on 3rd; counter resets), min-gap cooldown between breaks, no-question fallback (all-draft / empty pool ⇒ null, combat continues), idempotent open (second open returns the same break) + idempotent resolve (second resolve null, one record) + `cancel()` clears open break without recording (safe scene teardown), correct⇒'empower' / wrong⇒'combo-lost' with the resolution carrying NO hp/damage field (wrong ≠ instant death, structural), misconception recorded on wrong, and `summarize()` producing updated mastery. **Suite: 147 passing / 14 files.** `npm run build` exit 0.
- Gate: not every hit (cadence + gap, tested) ✓, one wrong answer ≠ instant death (no HP path; monster paused while break open, tested resolution shape) ✓, learning state updates (records → summarizeSession, tested) ✓, scene changes don't duplicate/lock events (idempotent open/resolve + cancel, tested) ✓, no-question fallback (tested) ✓, `knowledgeBreak` rollback flag present ✓.
